# @rumblestudio/**player-service**

**Rumble Player** is an open source HTML5 audio player.

It contains all the logic to play sound (from an url, a playlist object, an RSS feed, ...), with all the common methods (next, prev, shuffle, volume controls...) and a few extra features (preload, event callbacks, ...)

## Install

Install the package `@rumblestudio/player-service`:

```shell
npm install @rumblestudio/player-service
```

Note: The service has [HowlerJS](https://howlerjs.com/) <img width="100" src="https://howlerjs.com/assets/images/logo.svg"> as a dependency, a javascript library for audio manipulation and UUID to generate some unique ID for playlist processes.

## Usage

### Angular

To use the library within your Angular project the best way is to use an Angular Service

1. Create an angular project with a service

```shell
npm install -g @angular/cli # install Angular
ng new demo-player-angular # Create a new Angular app
cd demo-player-angula
ng g s audio # generate a service
```

2. Install the Rumble Player Service package:

```shell
npm install @rumblestudio/player-service
```

3. Import the Rumble Player Service into the Angular service. You can extends the Angular service class from Rumble Player Service or you can create a property `this.player = new PlayerService()`. The following example use the "extends" option:

In the file `demo-player-angular/src/app/audio.service.ts`:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import {
	Song,
	PlayerService,
	PlayerServiceEvent,
} from '@rumblestudio/player-service';
import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({
	providedIn: 'root',
})
export class AudioService extends PlayerService {
	public playlist$: BehaviorSubject<Song[]> = new BehaviorSubject<Song[]>([]);
	public index$: BehaviorSubject<number> = new BehaviorSubject<number>(-1);
	public percentage$: BehaviorSubject<number> = new BehaviorSubject(0);
	public position$: BehaviorSubject<number> = new BehaviorSubject(0);
	public playing$: BehaviorSubject<boolean> = new BehaviorSubject<boolean>(
		false,
	);

	constructor() {
		super(); // needed as this class extends the Rumble Player Service
		this.addNewOnCallback(this.on);
	}
	private on(event: PlayerServiceEvent) {
		// We convert the events into RxJS behaviour subject
		// so that you can subscribe to them the way you want.
		console.log('[audioService](on) new event:', event);
		this.playing$.next(this.isPlaying);
		this.index$.next(this.index);
		this.position$.next(this.position);
		this.percentage$.next(this.percentage);
	}
}
```

All events will trigger the `on` method in this example (new playlist, play, pause,...). You can filter on the event.type property, debounce the observables (see [debounceTime](https://rxmarbles.com/#debounceTime)) or filter if not distinct (see [distinctUntilChanged](https://rxmarbles.com/#distinctUntilChanged)) to avoid unnecessary observable triggers.

**A list of events is available further.**

4. Once you have an Angular service you can inject it in your components (for example in app.component.ts):

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { AudioService } from './audio.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'ng-rumble-player';

  constructor(private audioService:AudioService){
    ...
  }
}
```

5. Give something to play to your service:

```typescript
//...
export class AppComponent {
	//...

	loadSomeMusic() {
		// method 1
		// from a list of audio urls
		const urls = [
			'https://example.com/myAudioFile_1.mp3',
			'https://example.com/myAudioFile_2.wav',
			'https://example.com/myAudioFile_3.flac',
		];
		this.audioService.setPlaylistFromUrls(urls);

		// method 2
		// from a list of dict
		const songs: Partial<Song>[] = [
			{
				songTitle: 'my first song',
				file: 'https://example.com/myAudioFile_1.mp3',
				author: 'John Doe',
				songCover: 'https://example.com/cover_1.jpg',
				albumTitle: 'my amazing album',
			},
			//...
		];
		this.audioService.setPlaylistFromSongObjects(songs);

		// method 3
		// from a RSS feed URL
		const url =
			'https://www.omnycontent.com/d/playlist/2e6498c5-ff94-4726-ba20-ad1000f32d21/2bed1e53-84f7-4f9a-9071-ad1000f84f8f/5d9318ee-dcf8-4337-ae15-ad1000f97d0c/podcast.rss';
		this.audioService.setPLaylistFromRSSFeedURL(url);
	}

	play() {
		this.audioService.play();
	}
}
```

and call those methods as you like from app.component.html:

```html
<button (click)="loadSomeMusic()">load</button>
<button (click)="play()">play</button>
```

**A list of all methods is available further.**
